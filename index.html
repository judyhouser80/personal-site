      <h2>Hello</h2>
      <p><em>Full Stack Web Developer</em></p>
      <p class='intro'>I am new at web development. I am completing my boot camp and taking a refresher course. I began my first complete responsive website with a mobile app for a friend who is pastor at <em><strong><a href="http://www.mapleview.com/">Maple
              View Church</a></strong></em> that is like my second home. I love being with my family and relaxing and always excited to be in the moment and all the moments thereafter! I still believe in true love and I love watching sunrises,
        sunsets, puppies, kittens, my children - definitely my children, the ocean, walks on the beach, bonfires, cookouts, all things family!</p>

        <h3>Web designer and Programmer</h3>
        <p>I have always been in love with computer programming and code development.  I started back in the 1980s, but then put it on hold and had a family.  Later in the 90s I picked it up again and actually created several websites, but then, once again I laid it down and at taht point got away from it, until now.  I am so excited to finally be doing what I have always loved doing!</p>

        <h3>Mother/Mimi</h3>
        <p>I am a mother of 6 and a Mimi of 11! I have an amazing German Shep/Treeing Walker Hound fur baby.  I am so in love with my family!  Spending time with them is the absolute best way I can possibly spend my time.  My first love is God, second is my wonderful family and then lastly coding!  I am so incredibly blessed. </p>
